In this part, I will construct a data frame with four columns. The four columns are: a random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, a length-10 character vector, and a length-10 factor vector, from left to right.

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_unif = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical_compare_2 = ifelse(vec_unif > 2, TRUE, FALSE),
  vec_char = c("I", "am", "doing", "my", "second", "hw", "of", "p8015", "data", "science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male", "female", "male", "male",     "female", "male", "female", "male"))
  )
```

The data frame is shown below:

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_unif vec_logical_compare_2 vec_char vec_factor
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>                 <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    3.31  TRUE                  I        male      
    ##  2    2.37  TRUE                  am       female    
    ##  3    3.29  TRUE                  doing    male      
    ##  4    4.98  TRUE                  my       female    
    ##  5    2.44  TRUE                  second   male      
    ##  6    0.688 FALSE                 hw       male      
    ##  7    1.49  FALSE                 of       female    
    ##  8    2.54  TRUE                  p8015    male      
    ##  9    1.66  FALSE                 data     female    
    ## 10    3.67  TRUE                  science  male

In this part, I will try to take the mean of each variable in the data frame. It only wroked for the first colomn(vec\_nuif).
